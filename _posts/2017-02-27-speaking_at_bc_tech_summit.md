### About my session
I will be speaking at **The Data Visualization Challenge - Data Innovation in the BC Government**
afternoon session, which is part of Track 1 sessions on 14th of March.
You will be able to hear how BC Government is utilizing technology to innovate and improve its 
data visualization capacity and the usefulness of Crown data.

[BCStats](http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/Home.aspx) and [BC Innovation Council](http://bcic.ca/) 
prepared a data visualization challenge to create BC housing market visualization 
to enable planning and decision making on community growth based on housing data.
I will be presenting my solution to the challenge, using open source technologies
and open data from [BC Data Catalogue](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/databc/geographic-data-and-services/bc-data-catalogue)
and [Statistics Canada](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/).

I will compete against 4 others innovators (including those of the 
[Plotly](https://plot.ly/) fame). Five of us are finalists,
chosen among 33 problem solvers that submitted their proposals. Good luck everyone!
