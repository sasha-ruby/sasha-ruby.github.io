This chart was originally published on [SportStats dot Click](http://sportstats.click).

This chart highlights how comfortable Chelsea FC was in its run to English Premier League title in season 2014-2015. A couple of facts:

- Chelsea was in lead from round 1, and the only time it wasnâ€™t in top position was round 2, when Tottenham took the lead based on goal difference only.
- The only time some other team got really close is round 20, when Manchester City had the same number of points (Chelsea lost 5:3 to Tottenham). The ascent began in the very next round, and after only 4 matches, Chelsea was 7 points ahead of City.

> You can hover over chart points to highlight difference at that point.
