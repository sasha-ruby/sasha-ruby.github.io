Our [Ruby team](https://www.canadianopendataexperience.ca/teams/view/118) will be taking part in 
CODE 2015 - The Canadian Open Data Experience.

It is a 48-hour hackathon with data nerds and innovators across Canada will compete to 
build the best app utilizing federal government data from Canada's Open Government portal,
 as well as provincial and municipal data.
