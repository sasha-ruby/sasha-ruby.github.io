Our [Ruby team](https://www.canadianopendataexperience.ca/teams/view/118) will be taking part in 
CODE 2015 - The Canadian Open Data Experience. From the team list, we seem to be the only team
from Kelowna registered so far.

It is a 48-hour hackathon with data nerds and innovators across Canada will compete to 
build the best app utilizing federal government data from Canada's Open Government portal,
 as well as provincial and municipal data.

The hackathon starts at 6pm EST on February 20th, and ends at the same time on February 22nd.

Good luck to all the teams.
