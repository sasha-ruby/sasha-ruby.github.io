Wordiction is a text prediction app that predicts the next word to be typed in, 
based on previous text. It is developed in the scope of the Capstone Project for Coursera / John Hopkins Data Science Specialization.

It suggests three words most likely to be the next in the given context.

Prediction is based on corpus provided in Coursera Data Science Specialization 
Capstone project, which consists of texts extracted from extracts from Twitter, news and blog websites.
